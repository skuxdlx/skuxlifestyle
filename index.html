  <p>you can dress skux, drive skux cars, even have skux parents, but you still might not be skux. this is because you have not let skux into your heart, and made it a part of your personality. To be skux, make sure you always respect your elders unless they are your siblings or cousins (then its fair game). To live a skux lifestyle,
  you also have to eat skux, to do this have a diet of mcdonalds once a week, and whatever your parents make for the rest of the week. Further integration of skux into your life, make sure to say on top of your fitness by playing basketball, rugby, going for walks in the sunset, and all forms of exercise.

Mana esentialy means integrity, or having a good heart (heart is manawa in maori). So when you do this awesome act of being, make sure to pour your entire soul into each wave. When you do this wave, start from as far back as you can extend your arm, and then throw
